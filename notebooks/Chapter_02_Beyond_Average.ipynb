    "\"Concept first,\" Kabir said. \"Then maybe the math if it's not too scary.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Fair. The concept is simple: **variance measures the typical distance of each score from the average.** If Player A's scores are all close to thirty-three, variance is low. If Player B's scores are far from thirty-three, variance is high.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"How do you calculate it?\" Ananya asked, pen poised.\n",

    "## 📚 Key Concepts from Chapter 2\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Law of Large Numbers (Intuitive)\n",
    "- Small samples (like 50 coin flips) can show lots of variation\n",
    "- With more data, the proportion stabilizes near the true value\n",
    "- Be suspicious of conclusions drawn from tiny samples\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Normal Variation vs. Genuine Anomaly\n",
    "- Random processes naturally vary\n",
    "- Not every deviation from expected is meaningful\n",
    "- Learning to distinguish signal from noise is crucial\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Average Isn't Everything\n",
    "- Two datasets can have the same average but tell completely different stories\n",
    "- Need to know both center (average) and spread (variation)\n",
    "- **The distribution shape matters as much as the central tendency**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Measures of Spread\n",
    "- **Range**: Simplest measure (max - min), but only uses two data points\n",
    "- **Variance**: Average squared distance from the mean\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance, easier to interpret\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Context Determines Value\n",
    "- Sometimes you want consistency (Player A, steady farmer)\n",
    "- Sometimes you want high variance (Player B when desperate, venture capital)\n",
    "- Understanding your goals helps you interpret variation\n",
