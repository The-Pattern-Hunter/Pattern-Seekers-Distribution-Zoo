    "\n",
    "*\"But here's what I've learned: **Understanding and exam success aren't opposites. They're... connected.** When I really understand distributions, I don't need to memorize which formula to use—I can derive it. When I understand why variance measures spread, I can solve variations of problems, not just the ones I've practiced.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"And honestly? Even if I don't get into IIT—and that's possible, it's competitive—I've learned to THINK. That won't become useless. I can't unlearn how to see patterns, build models, question assumptions. Whether I'm an engineer, doctor, teacher, or anything else, these skills matter.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"I'm not saying don't care about exams. They matter. They open doors. But don't let them be the ONLY thing. Don't let them kill your curiosity.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**A boy in the back spoke up:** *\"So you're saying we can do both? Exam prep AND actual learning?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Priya answered:** *\"We're saying they're not as separate as everyone thinks. The real learning HELPS exam prep. And the time you spend understanding isn't wasted—it's invested.\"*"
