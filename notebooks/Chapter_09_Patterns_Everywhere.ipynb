    "Two months after the monsoon ended, Ananya couldn't stop seeing patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The morning bus to school arrived at 7:43 AM most days, but with a variation of ± 4 minutes—roughly normal distribution. The number of students absent each day seemed to follow something like a Poisson process. Even her mother's grocery shopping amounts clustered around ₹800 with predictable spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You've become obsessed,\" Kabir teased one afternoon, watching her sketch a histogram of their cafeteria's lunch line wait times during their break.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Not obsessed,\" Ananya protested. \"Just... aware. **Once you learn to see distributions, you can't unsee them.**\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She was right. The monsoon project had changed something fundamental. What began as helping Uncle Bikram had become a new way of seeing the world. Weather patterns, cricket statistics, disease spread, even the scatter of classmates' test scores: all of it following patterns, dancing with uncertainty in predictable ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was November now, the post-monsoon clarity settling over Sambalpur. School had returned to its normal rhythm—tests, homework, the relentless march toward board exams. But something was different. Word of their insurance company victory had spread. The state science fair invitation sat on Ananya's desk. And everywhere she looked, she saw questions that could be answered with the tools they'd learned.\n",

    "## 📚 Key Concepts from Chapter 9\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Universal Application\n",
    "- Probability thinking applies to nearly every domain\n",
    "- Sports, genetics, disease, finance, manufacturing, education\n",
    "- **Once you learn to see distributions, you can't unsee them**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Domain-Specific Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cricket Analytics:**\n",
    "- Player profiles: Consistent, Volatile, Declining\n",
    "- Team selection should consider variance, not just average\n",
    "\n",
    "**Genetics:**\n",
    "- Mendelian inheritance is binomial distribution\n",
    "- Genetic counseling uses probability to assess risk\n",
    "\n",
    "**Epidemiology:**\n",
    "- SIR model: Susceptible, Infected, Recovered\n",
    "- R₀ (basic reproduction number) is expected value\n",
    "- Disease curves are predictable distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finance:**\n",
    "- Stock returns follow distributions (with fat tails)\n",
    "- Risk management = managing variance\n",
    "- High volatility = high standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Manufacturing:**\n",
    "- Quality control uses normal distribution\n",
    "- Six Sigma: Keep defects within ±6σ\n",
    "- Statistical process control\n",
    "\n",
    "**Education:**\n",
    "- Test scores designed to be normally distributed\n",
    "- Percentile ranks are distributional statements\n",
    "- Norm-referenced vs criterion-referenced testing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Teaching as Learning\n",
    "- Ananya presents at school assembly\n",
    "- Explaining concepts to others deepens understanding\n",
    "- Mathematics as service to community\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Professional Validation\n",
    "- Real professionals use these tools daily\n",
    "- Same mathematics, different applications\n",
    "- Pattern-seeking is a transferable skill\n",
