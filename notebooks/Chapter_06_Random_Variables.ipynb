    "\n",
    "### 1. Random Variables\n",
    "- Formal name for quantities that depend on chance\n",
    "- Given capital letters: X, Y, Z\n",
    "- Can be discrete (countable) or continuous (any value in range)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Expected Value E(X)\n",
    "- Long-run average\n",
    "- Formula: Σ [value × probability]\n",
    "- The \"center of gravity\" of a distribution\n",
    "- Tool for rational decision-making under uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Variance and Standard Deviation\n",
    "- Variance (σ²): Average squared distance from mean\n",
    "- Standard Deviation (σ): Square root of variance\n",
    "- Measures spread, consistency, predictability\n",
    "- High variance = risky, volatile\n",
    "- Low variance = consistent, reliable\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Probability Distributions\n",
    "- Complete description of a random variable\n",
    "- Specifies all possible values and their probabilities\n",
    "- Characterized by parameters (μ, σ, etc.)\n",
    "- The model IS the distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Parameters vs. Statistics\n",
    "- **Parameters (Greek)**: True population values (μ, σ)\n",
    "- **Statistics (Roman)**: Sample estimates (x̄, s)\n",
    "- We estimate parameters from data\n",
    "- Never have perfect certainty—only estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. The 68-95-99.7 Rule\n",
    "For normal distributions:\n",
    "- ~68% of data within ±1σ of mean\n",
    "- ~95% of data within ±2σ of mean\n",
    "- ~99.7% of data within ±3σ of mean\n",
