    "- Then housing prices fell\n",
    "- Millions lost homes, global economy collapsed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why the Models Failed:\n",
    "1. **Wrong assumption**: Historical data showed prices rising, but this wasn't a law of nature\n",
    "2. **Limited data**: Only ~60 years of housing data, missing the Great Depression\n",
    "3. **Extrapolation error**: Assumed past patterns would continue forever\n",
    "4. **Missing systemic risk**: Didn't account for \"what if everyone defaults at once?\"\n",
    "5. **Conflict of interest**: Modelers were paid to produce optimistic results\n",

    "### The Problem with Normal Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Your rainfall model assumes normal distribution. That means extreme events—things beyond 3 or 4 standard deviations—are vanishingly rare.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He did a calculation:\n",
    "- Probability of 4σ event in normal distribution: 0.003%\n",
    "- That's once every 30,000+ observations\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But reality? Extreme events happen MORE often than normal distributions predict. We call these **fat-tailed distributions**. The 'tails' are fatter—more probability in extreme regions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "- **1999 Odisha Super Cyclone**: 260 km/h winds, killed 10,000 people\n",
    "- **2019 Cyclone Fani**: Strongest storm since 1999\n",
    "- **August 2024**: 218mm rainfall (beyond model's prediction)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"These are **Black Swan events**—rare, extreme, and having massive impact. Normal distributions underestimate them.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ananya felt a chill. \"So our model... could miss the next catastrophic event?\"\n",
    "\n",

    "### What Climate Models Show:\n",
    "\n",

    "- Earth is warming\n",
    "- Humans are the cause (burning fossil fuels)\n",
    "- Warming will continue if emissions continue\n",

    "Climate models suggest:\n",
    "- More erratic monsoons\n",
    "- Higher frequency of extreme events\n",
    "- Longer dry spells followed by intense rainfall\n",
    "- Overall increased uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Your rainfall model might become outdated in 20 years,\" Professor said. \"Not because it's bad, but because **climate change is shifting the patterns**. Your fifty-year historical data might stop being predictive.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "### What You Learned in This Chapter:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Famous Model Failures**\n",
    "   - 2008 Financial Crisis: Wrong assumptions about housing prices\n",
    "   - Black Swan events: Reality has fatter tails than normal distribution predicts\n",
    "   - Models fail when assumptions break\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why Models Break**\n",
    "   - Wrong assumptions\n",
    "   - Missing variables\n",
    "   - Extrapolation beyond data range\n",
    "   - Fat-tailed distributions (extreme events more common than predicted)\n",
    "   - Changing systems (climate change, social change)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Correlation ≠ Causation**\n",
    "   - Spurious correlations are everywhere\n",
    "   - Always look for confounding variables\n",
    "   - Ask: Could X cause Y? Could Y cause X? Could Z cause both?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ethical Responsibilities**\n",
    "   - Models have real-world consequences\n",
    "   - Bad models can perpetuate injustice\n",
    "   - Always ask: Who benefits? Who might be harmed?\n",
    "   - Transparency is an ethical obligation\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Climate Change Uncertainty**\n",
    "   - Most complex modeling challenge\n",
    "   - High confidence in warming, uncertainty in details\n",
    "   - Honest uncertainty doesn't mean inaction\n",
    "   - Historical models may become outdated\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **The Humility Principle**\n",
    "   - **\"All models are wrong, but some are useful\"**\n",
    "   - Best modelers are humble, transparent, willing to update\n",
    "   - Bad modelers are arrogant, hide limitations, refuse to change\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical Insight:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The goal of modeling isn't to be right—it's to be honest, helpful, and humble.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect prediction is impossible. Useful prediction with transparent uncertainty is achievable."
