    "\n",
    "\"That's different,\" Kabir protested.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"Excellent question.\" Professor set down his glass and pulled out a rupee coin from his pocket. \"Let's think about what probability actually *means*. Kabir, what does it mean to say this coin has probability 0.5 of landing heads?\"\n",

    "**\"Exactly right!\"** Professor slapped his knee. **\"Probability of 0.5 doesn't mean *every* flip is 50% heads—that doesn't even make sense. One flip is either heads or tails, 100% one or the other. What it means is: *in the long run*, about half will be heads.\"**\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Probability as Long-Run Frequency\n",
    "- Probability 0.5 doesn't mean every flip is 50% heads\n",
    "- It means: in the long run, about half will be heads\n",
    "- Individual events are unpredictable, but patterns emerge\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Law of Large Numbers\n",
    "- As sample size increases, sample average approaches expected value\n",
    "- Absolute difference may grow, but proportional difference shrinks\n",
    "- Small samples: Randomness dominates\n",
    "- Large samples: Pattern emerges\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Expected Value\n",
    "- Weighted average of all possible outcomes\n",
    "- Formula: E(X) = Σ [P(outcome) × value of outcome]\n",
    "- Doesn't predict individual result\n",
    "- Predicts long-run average\n",
    "- Used in insurance, gambling, decision-making\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Distribution Reveals True Nature\n",
    "- Fair coin: Symmetric distribution centered at p=0.5\n",
    "- Biased coin: Shifted distribution\n",
    "- Shape of distribution tells you about underlying process\n",
    "- Real-world data is rarely perfectly symmetric\n",
