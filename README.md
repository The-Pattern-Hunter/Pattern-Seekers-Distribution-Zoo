# 🦁 The Pattern Seekers: Adventures in the Distribution Zoo

### Where curiosity meets probability — and mathematics learns to tell stories.

> *Companion interactive notebooks for the book by Alok Patel*

---

## 🎪 Welcome to the Distribution Zoo!

Just like Ananya, Kabir, and Priya discovered in the book, every dataset has a "species" — a distribution shape that tells its story. Is your data a **Normal Bell Curve** (the friendly giant)? An **Exponential** (the memoryless wonder)? Or maybe a **Power Law** (the extreme inequality beast)?

In these interactive notebooks, you'll:
- 🔬 Explore all 8 distributions from Chapter 5
- 📊 Build real models like the students in the book  
- 🎨 Create visualizations that reveal patterns
- 🐍 Learn Python along the way (no experience needed!)
- 🌧️ Work with actual Odisha rainfall data

**No installation required** — everything runs free in Google Colab!

## 🦒 The Distribution Zoo Guide

### The 8 Species You'll Meet:

| Distribution | Personality | Found In | Chapter |
|-------------|-------------|----------|---------|
| 🔔 **Normal (Bell Curve)** | The friendly giant | Heights, test scores, errors | 1, 4 |
| 📊 **Uniform** | The egalitarian | Dice rolls, random selections | 5 |
| 📉 **Exponential** | The memoryless | Waiting times, decay | 5 |
| 🎲 **Poisson** | The rare event counter | Phone calls, accidents | 5 |
| 📈 **Log-Normal** | The multiplication master | Income, file sizes | 5 |
| ⚡ **Power Law** | The extreme inequality beast | Wealth, city sizes | 5 |
| ✅ **Binomial** | The yes/no accumulator | Coin flips, success counts | 3 |
| 👥 **Bimodal** | The split personality | Mixed populations | 5 |

**Pro tip:** Each has a distinct "sound" when you learn to listen!
